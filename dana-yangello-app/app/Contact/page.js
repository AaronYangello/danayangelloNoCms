`
Dana, can you briefly walk us through your story â€“ how you started and how you got to where you are today.
I am an actor, improviser, and ballroom dancer, located in Burbank, CA. I was born and raised in South Jersey, where my love for performing and connecting with others through dance began. I grew up in a family that was always the first on the dance floor and the last to leave. My family will always be my greatest influence and support system....
